    Even if you donâ€™t like kale, this superfood is worth a try using this
    dressing. Let the kale marinate in the dressing to soften it and infuse the
    flavor of the dressing. For a lot of kale, double the ingredients. If you like
    Sweet Greens salads, this will remind you of that.
ingredients:
    - 1 spoonful mustard (Grey Poupon is best)
    - 1 spoonful honey
    - 1 spoonful chopped garlic
    - 1 spoonful lemon juice
    - 1/3 cup olive oil
    - Salt and pepper to taste
tools:
    - Cutting board
    - Knife
    - Salad bowl or container
    - Sealable Jar
    - Spoon
method: >-
    Wash kale, remove stems, and chop fine. Place kale in bowl and set aside.


    Place dressing ingredients into a sealable glass jar and shake vigorously to
    mix well.


    Pour dressing over kale and mix well.


    Let this salad sit for a while so the kale will marinate and soften. You just
    created a superfood feast!
