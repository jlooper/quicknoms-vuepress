    Every cook should be able to whip up a good guacamole. The secret is getting
    avocadoes that are ripe, or ripening them at home until they are a bit soft to
    the touch (not squishy). You can ripen them in a brown paper bag to speed up
    the process.
ingredients:
    - 1 avocado
    - 1 T garlic
    - 1 T lime juice
tools:
    - Fork
    - Bowl
    - Knife
method: >-
    Smash everything together in a bowl, using a fork.


    Serve with chips.


    This recipe can be doubled.


    A tip for cutting avocadoes: wash the unpeeled avocado and run a knife around
    the perimeter, circling the nut. Twist to open into two halves. Discard the
    nut and use a spoon to scoop out the ripe meat. Often it comes out in one
    piece.
