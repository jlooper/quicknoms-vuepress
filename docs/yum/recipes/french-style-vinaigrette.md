description: >-
  If you eat salad in a French home, you will probably encounter this simple,
  homemade way of making salad dressing.
ingredients:
  - Red-wine vinegar
  - Salad oil (like Sunflower oil)
  - Salt and Pepper
  - Good quality mustard (Grey Poupon is always good)
tools:
  - Mixing bowl
  - Spoon
method: >-
  Put about a tablespoonful of mustard in the bottom of the bowl


  Add two spoonfuls of red-wine vinegar and two spoonfuls of salad oil together
  in the bottom of the mixing bowl.


  Mix everything together well. Oil and vinegar don’t like to mix so you need to
  mix quickly.


  Sprinkle with salt and pepper


  You can put lettuce on top of this mix and fold in the dressing to make a
  salad immediately, or save it for later (you’ll want to mix again before
  serving)
