  If you get good quality, thin-sliced meat cutlets, you can get creative with
  the type of meat you use. This recipe works best however with white meat like
  chicken, turkey, or pork.
ingredients:
  - 1/4-inch thin-sliced meat cutlets
  - cooking oil
  - flour
  - 1 egg
  - package bread crumbs or panko (japanese-style bread crumbs)
tools:
  - Three medium bowls
  - Fork
  - Plate
  - Frying Pan
method: >-
  Put the flour in one bowl, the bread crumbs in another bowl, and crack the egg
  and stir it until it is mixed into the third bowl


  Assemble the cutlets assembly-line style. Dip the cutlet first in flour, then
  the egg mixture, then the bread crumbs and set aside


  When the cutlets are ready to cook, heat 3 tablespoons of oil over a
  medium-hot stove


  Brown the cutlets, a few at a time, in the oil. Add more oil if necessary,
  heating it before you add more cutlets.


  To keep cutlets warm and crispy before serving, put them on an ovenproof plate
  and heat in a stove, or place in a warm toaster oven.


  Tip: If you have any extra seasoning on hand, you can jazz up this dish by
  mixing the seasoning in with the flour
