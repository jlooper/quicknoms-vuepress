  Just in time for game day, or any day, delicious pepper salt wings. This
  recipe is inspired by some great wings my sister-in-law cooked for us.
ingredients:
  - 6 Chicken wings
  - 1 T Peppercorns
  - 1 T Sea salt or Kosher salt
  - Olive oil
tools:
  - Knife
  - Cutting board
  - Pan
  - Foil
  - Grinder or mortar and pestle
method: >-
  Wash the wings and cut them at the joints. Discard the tips. Make sure no
  feathers remain


  In a pan, roast the peppercorns and salt over a hot stove, stirring or shaking
  to make sure the peppercorns cook evenly. After about 5 minutes, when the
  mixture is fragrant, remove from heat.


  Grind up the pepper and salt together in a grinder, blender, or mortar and
  pestle.


  Line the roasting pan with foil. Place the wings inside and coat them with the
  seasoning. Turn over and coat the other side. Drizzle with a little oil.


  Close the foil and bake at 350 degrees for about an hour


  Now youâ€™re ready for the game!
