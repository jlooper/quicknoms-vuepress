description: >-
  Use the thin-sliced beef strips that are cheap. Because the peanut butter
  sauce already has salt, I use low-salt soy sauce to thin it. This is a
  quick-and-easy recipe!
ingredients:
  - Thinly-sliced beef strips
  - 1/4 cup peanut butter
  - 1/4 cup low-salt soy sauce
  - >-
    cooked rice (you can find microwavable rice if you don’t want to or can’t
    cook your own)
tools:
  - Mixing bowls
  - Wooden spoon
  - Frying pan
method: |-
  Mix the peanut butter and soy sauce in a bowl

  Start browning the beef in the frying pan

  Pour the sauce over and continue to cook until the beef is cooked.

  Remove from pan and serve over hot rice with a green vegetable side dish
