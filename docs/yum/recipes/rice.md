    Preparing rice the Asian way, without the use of pre-packaged mixes, is easy
    if you have a rice cooker. But if you don’t, here’s how to do it on a stove.
ingredients:
    - rice
    - water
tools:
    - Non-stick pot with lid
    - Spoon
method: |-
    Put 1/2 cup of dry short-grained rice per person served into a pot

    Swish the rice in water a few times and drain to rinse it

    Add water to cover the rice plus about 1/2 inch extra over the rice

    Boil the rice over medium-high heat, stirring until the water is absorbed

    Cover with lid, turn down the heat to simmer, and wait about 10 minutes

    Rice is ready to serve when it is soft.
