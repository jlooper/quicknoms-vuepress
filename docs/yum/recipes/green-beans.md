  Blanching and then sauteeing green beans is an old restaurant trick. Even
  though it’s a two-step process it’s still quick and easy. It creates the
  perfect texture: tender beans that don’t dry out. This version uses
  microwave-in-bag green beans, so you only have one pan to wash.  The fragrant
  toasted pepper makes this SO much more than simple buttered green beans, even
  though the ingredients are the same. This recipe is courtesy of QuickNoms
  reader Nadira Jamal 
ingredients:
  - 1 package microwave-in-bag green beans
  - 2 Tbsp Butter (or more to taste. be bold)
  - Fresh-ground pepper to taste (but add more than you think you need)
  - Salt (if you like fancy sea salts this is a good place to use them)
tools:
  - Microwave
  - Skillet
  - Wooden spoon
method: >-
  Puncture the bag of green beans to allow steam to escape as they cook.
  Microwave on high for 3 minutes. (Alternatively: cook according to the package
  directions, subtracting 1-2 minutes from the cooking time.) The green beans
  should be nearly cooked: bright green, but still but quite firm, and they
  should still “squeak” against your teeth when you bit into one.


  Remove the green beans from the microwave bag, draining any excess liquid.


  Meanwhile, heat a skillet over medium heat. Add the butter and pepper. Stir
  occasionally as the butter melts, allowing the pepper to lightly toast and
  become fragrant.


  When the foam on the butter is mostly gone, add the green beans to the butter.
  Cook another 2-4 minutes, or until they reach the desired tenderness. (If this
  goes too slowly, you can turn the heat up to medium-high.) Salt to taste.


  Tips:


  The toasted pepper is what makes this dish so snappy. So don’t skip the
  toasting step, and add it generously! As my Auntie Josie used to say (in
  another recipe) “when it looks like you have too much pepper, double it!”


  You can use loose green beans instead of the microwave-in-bag kind. Trim the
  beans, then cook them in rapidly boiling water for about 4 minutes, and drain.
  Then proceed as written.
