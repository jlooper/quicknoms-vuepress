  Corn on the cob is easy to make, especially if you have a big pot for cooking.
  Look for sweet corn in season in the grocery store. You can tell if corn is
  good quality by looking at the tip of the ear - the kernels should come all
  the way to the top with no gaps and be light yellow and juicy, not shrunken.
ingredients:
  - Ears of sweet corn
  - Butter
  - Salt and pepper
tools:
  - Stock pot
  - Knife
  - Wooden utensils to manage hot corn
method: >-
  Strip off all the leaves and corn silk and wash the ears of corn


  Trim the top and bottom to make the ends even


  Boil water in the stock pot


  When it is boiling, drop in the ears of corn


  Cook for about 4 minutes and remove from pot


  To serve, guests can salt/pepper/butter their corn to taste. Itâ€™s easiest to
  eat if you have corn holders but not necessary.
