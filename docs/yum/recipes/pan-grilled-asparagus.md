        Asparagus (1 bunch feeds 2-4 people depending on how much they like their

    - Salt (to taste)

    Wash the asparagus spears, snap off the woody ends, and dry them thoroughly
    with paper towels or a cloth.


    Heat a heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high to high heat. (My stove goes up
    to 9. I do this on 7.)


    When the pan is hot, add the asparagus spears to the dry pan. Cook, rolling
    them frequently, for 5-7 minutes, until the spears turn bright green and
    flexible, and are darkly browned or lightly charred.


    Move the spears to a bowl or serving dish, toss with butter and lemon or lime
    juice, then add salt to taste.


    Tips:


    The spears are meant to be slightly al dente. If you prefer your asparagus
    cooked until tender, cook for a longer time on slightly lower heat.


    You can substitute olive oil and garlic for butter and lemon for a different
    flavor profile.


    Lemon or lime zest is a tasty addition.


    If you donâ€™t want to waste the woody ends of the asparagus, you can peel the
    outer layers with a vegetable peeler instead. Or save the ends and make soup
    with them later.


    Top the asparagus with a fried or poached egg and add a piece of good bread,
    and it makes an easy brunch or light dinner.
