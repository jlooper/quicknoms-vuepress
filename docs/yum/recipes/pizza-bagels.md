  Pizza bagels are easy and filling. Make some now, freeze some for later in a
  zip-lock bag. In the video, we donâ€™t use bagels but rather purchased pizza
  dough - either is fine!
ingredients:
  - Plain bagels
  - Red sauce (pizza sauce or other marinara-type sauce as you prefer)
  - Shredded mozzarella cheese
  - Pepperoni (pre-cut is easiest to deal with)
  - Optional extras like some mushrooms or green pepper strips
tools:
  - Toaster oven
  - Knife
method: |-
  Cut the bagels in half and lay side by side

  Spread the red sauce onto the bagel halves, not using too much

  Sprinkle with shredded cheese

  Cover with pepperoni and other optional toppings

  Toast in toaster oven for 5 minutes or until cheese bubbles.
