    If it’s snowing outside, here’s a fun, easy, traditional indoor cooking recipe
    for the whole family
ingredients:
    - Fresh snow
    - 1 cup maple syrup (only use the real thing)
tools:
    - Mixing bowl
    - Spoon
    - Pan
    - Small bowl of cold water
method: >-
    Get a bowl of clean snow ready


    Boil the maple syrup in a pan, stirring constantly so it won’t burn


    Periodically drop a tiny bit of the hot syrup into the bowl. It will form a
    soft jelly, then a soft ball, then become a hard ball when it’s been boiled
    enough
