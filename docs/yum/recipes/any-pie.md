description: >-
  Use any fruit combination to make a wonderful pie! Try apple or
  strawberry/rhubarb combinations. You might want to add some cornstarch for
  very juicy fruits like blueberry.
ingredients:
  - 3 cups fruit slices (see below)
  - 1/4 sugar to taste plus 2 T sugar
  - 2 frozen pie crusts
tools:
  - Pie dish (glass or metal) - aluminum is ok too
  - Knife and peeler for cutting fruit and piercing dough.
method: >-
  Note about fruit: If using apples, peel, core, and slice them. If using
  rhubarb, use half rhubarb, chopped, and half strawberries, hulled and
  sliced.   


  Place one circle of pie dough into the pie dish.


  Mound up the fruit of choice inside.


  Sprinkle 1/4 sugar over the fruit. For a very juicy type of fruit, sprinkle 1T
  cornstarch as well. Add a bit of cinnamon for an apple pie.


  Cover with second circle of dough and crimp the edges to seal, using your
  fingers or a fork.


  Pierce the pie crust in a pattern on top a few times.


  Sprinkle 2T sugar on top of crust. 


  Bake at 350 until brown, about 30-40 minutes. Don't let the crust get too
  brown.
